## 🔧 **Critical Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Pairing Process Hanging (RESOLVED ✅)**

- **Impact**: Pairing now completes successfully in ~2 seconds

### 2. **Configuration File Format Mismatch (RESOLVED ✅)**

- **Fix**: Updated installer to generate correct simple YAML format
- **Impact**: Config files work immediately without manual editing

### 3. **Service Permission Issues (RESOLVED ✅)**
- **Issue**: Service couldn't start after installation due to permission problems
- **Root Cause**: Inadequate directory permissions for service operation
- **Fix**: Enhanced permission setup functions in installer
- **Impact**: Service starts automatically after pairing

### 4. **Manual Configuration Required (RESOLVED ✅)**
