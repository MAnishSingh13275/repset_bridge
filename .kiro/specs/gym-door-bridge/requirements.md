# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gym Door Access Bridge is a lightweight local agent that connects gym door access hardware (fingerprint, RFID, or other devices) with our SaaS platform. The bridge normalizes check-in events from various hardware types into a standardized format and securely forwards them to our cloud system. It operates in multiple performance tiers to accommodate different hardware capabilities and includes offline functionality to ensure reliable data capture even during network outages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a gym administrator, I want to connect any door access hardware to our SaaS platform, so that all member check-ins are automatically recorded in our system regardless of the hardware vendor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member uses fingerprint authentication THEN the bridge SHALL capture the check-in event and normalize it to our standard format
2. WHEN a member uses RFID card authentication THEN the bridge SHALL capture the check-in event and normalize it to our standard format
3. WHEN no hardware is available THEN the bridge SHALL operate in simulator mode to allow manual testing
4. WHEN different hardware vendors are used THEN the bridge SHALL use adapter patterns to support multiple device types
5. IF hardware communication fails THEN the bridge SHALL log the error and continue operating

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a gym administrator, I want the bridge to work on any Windows or macOS computer, so that I can use existing hardware without purchasing new equipment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installed on Windows THEN the bridge SHALL run as a Windows service
2. WHEN installed on macOS THEN the bridge SHALL run as a macOS daemon
3. WHEN running on low-spec hardware THEN the bridge SHALL automatically operate in Lite mode
4. WHEN running on standard hardware THEN the bridge SHALL operate in Normal mode
5. WHEN running on high-spec hardware THEN the bridge SHALL operate in Full mode with enhanced features
6. IF system resources are constrained THEN the bridge SHALL automatically adjust its performance tier

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gym administrator, I want secure communication between the bridge and our cloud platform, so that member data is protected and unauthorized access is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pairing a new device THEN the bridge SHALL use a one-time Pair Code for initial registration
2. WHEN sending requests to the cloud THEN the bridge SHALL use HMAC authentication with a unique deviceKey
3. WHEN device keys need rotation THEN the bridge SHALL support key rotation without service interruption
4. IF HMAC validation fails THEN the cloud SHALL reject the request and log the security event
5. WHEN device access is revoked THEN the bridge SHALL be unable to authenticate with the cloud

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a gym member, I want my check-ins to be recorded even when the internet is down, so that my gym access history is complete and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the bridge SHALL queue check-in events locally
2. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the bridge SHALL replay queued events in chronological order
3. WHEN local queue reaches capacity THEN the bridge SHALL implement a retention policy for oldest events
4. IF duplicate events are sent THEN the cloud SHALL use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate attendance records
5. WHEN offline for extended periods THEN the bridge SHALL maintain data integrity and prevent corruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a gym administrator, I want to monitor the status of my door access bridge, so that I can ensure it's working properly and troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bridge is running THEN it SHALL provide a /health endpoint with current status
2. WHEN the bridge is operational THEN it SHALL send periodic heartbeat messages to the cloud
3. WHEN viewed in the admin portal THEN I SHALL see device status, last seen time, and current performance tier
4. WHEN the queue has pending events THEN the portal SHALL display queue depth
5. IF the bridge goes offline THEN the portal SHALL show an alert and last known status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a gym administrator, I want easy installation and setup of the bridge, so that I can get door access integration working without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing on Windows THEN a one-liner PowerShell script SHALL download, configure, and install the bridge
2. WHEN installing on macOS THEN a one-liner bash script SHALL download, configure, and install the bridge
3. WHEN pairing the device THEN the installation script SHALL use the Pair Code to automatically configure authentication
4. WHEN installation completes THEN the bridge SHALL be running as a system service
5. IF installation fails THEN clear error messages SHALL guide troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a gym administrator, I want to map external user IDs from my door hardware to members in our system, so that check-ins are attributed to the correct member accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a check-in event contains an external user ID THEN the system SHALL map it to the corresponding member
2. WHEN setting up user mappings THEN the admin portal SHALL provide a user-friendly mapping interface
3. WHEN an unmapped external ID is encountered THEN the system SHALL log the event for manual review
4. IF mapping conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options in the admin interface
5. WHEN user mappings change THEN historical data SHALL remain consistent with original mappings

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for bridge devices, so that I can proactively address issues before they impact gym operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bridge goes offline THEN the system SHALL send an alert to administrators
2. WHEN queue depth exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate capacity warnings
3. WHEN HMAC authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security alerts
4. WHEN bridge performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL escalate alerts through appropriate channels

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a gym administrator, I want the bridge to handle door unlock operations, so that members can gain physical access when their check-in is successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid check-in occurs THEN the bridge SHALL trigger door unlock for a configurable duration
2. WHEN door unlock is requested via API THEN the bridge SHALL provide a /open-door endpoint
3. WHEN unlock duration expires THEN the door SHALL automatically re-lock
4. IF door hardware communication fails THEN the bridge SHALL log the error but continue processing check-ins
5. WHEN in simulator mode THEN door operations SHALL be logged without actual hardware interaction

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the bridge to be easily deployable and updatable, so that we can roll out improvements and security patches efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new versions are available THEN the bridge SHALL check for updates via manifest.json
2. WHEN updates are found THEN the bridge SHALL download and install updates automatically
3. WHEN compiled THEN the bridge SHALL be a single binary with no external dependencies
4. IF Docker deployment is preferred THEN a Docker image SHALL be available
5. WHEN distributing updates THEN a CDN SHALL host binaries and update manifests
