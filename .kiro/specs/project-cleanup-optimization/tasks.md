  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [x] 2. Clean build artifacts and executables from version control

  - Remove executables from all `releases/GymDoorBridge-v*/` directories
  - _Requirements: 1.3_

- [x] 3. Remove runtime data files from version control

  - Delete database files: `bridge.db`, `bridge.db-shm`, `bridge.db-wal` from root
  - Ensure these files are properly gitignored (already done in .gitignore)
  - _Requirements: 1.5_

- [x] 4. Consolidate installation scripts

  - Remove duplicate installation scripts from root directory
  - Delete `simple-repset-installer.ps1` from root
  - Delete `repset-bridge-installer-FIXED.ps1` from root
  - Delete `setup-heartbeat-task.ps1` from root
  - Delete `bridge-heartbeat-service.ps1` from root
  - Keep only the organized scripts in `scripts/` and `public/` directories
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [x] 5. Consolidate test directories

- [ ] 5. Consolidate test directories

  - Merge content from `tests/` directory into `test/` directory
  - Organize PowerShell test scripts into appropriate test subdirectories
  - Remove the redundant `tests/` directory after migration
  - Update any references to the old test directory structure
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2_

- [x] 6. Clean up release directory structure

  - Remove outdated release zip files that are duplicates
  - Keep only the most recent and necessary release artifacts
  - Remove `releases/GymDoorBridge-v1.3.0-FIXED.zip` (duplicate)
  - Organize release management scripts properly
  - _Requirements: 4.2_

- [x] 7. Remove duplicate configuration files

  - Remove `config.yaml` from root (runtime file, already gitignored)
  - Consolidate duplicate `config.yaml.example` files from releases directories
  - Ensure examples directory has comprehensive configuration examples
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.5_

- [x] 8. Validate and optimize .gitignore effectiveness

  - Verify that all build artifacts are properly excluded
  - Ensure runtime data files are ignored
  - Test that the current .gitignore prevents future artifact commits
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2_

- [x] 9. Create file cleanup automation script

  - Build a cleanup script that can identify and remove duplicate files
  - Implement file hash comparison for duplicate detection
  - Create backup mechanism before cleanup operations
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 10. Validate Go project structure and dependencies

  - Verify `go.mod` is properly configured
  - Check that `internal/` and `pkg/` directories follow Go conventions
  - Ensure all import paths are correct after cleanup
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.3_

- [x] 11. Update documentation references

  - Fix any broken links caused by file removals
  - Update installation documentation to reference correct script locations
  - Ensure all documentation points to the correct file paths
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.5_

- [x] 12. Security scan and cleanup


  - Scan for any hardcoded credentials in configuration files
  - Ensure database files with potential sensitive data are removed
  - Validate that example configurations don't contain real credentials
  - _Requirements: 10.1_

- [x] 13. Final validation and testing




  - Test that build processes work after cleanup
  - Verify that all essential functionality remains intact
  - Run comprehensive tests to ensure nothing was broken
  - Validate that the project structure follows best practices
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_
