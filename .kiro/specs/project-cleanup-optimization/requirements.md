# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for cleaning, optimizing, restructuring, and enhancing the Gym Door Access Bridge project. The project currently suffers from significant redundancy, poor organization, duplicate files, inconsistent documentation, and scattered build artifacts that need comprehensive cleanup and restructuring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File Deduplication and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate and redundant files removed so that the project is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove duplicate README files in releases directories
2. WHEN examining configuration files THEN the system SHALL consolidate duplicate config examples into a single examples directory
3. WHEN reviewing build artifacts THEN the system SHALL remove outdated build files and executables from the repository
4. WHEN checking documentation THEN the system SHALL eliminate redundant documentation that duplicates information
5. WHEN scanning for temporary files THEN the system SHALL remove database files, logs, and other runtime artifacts that shouldn't be in version control

### Requirement 2: Directory Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and logical directory structure so that I can easily navigate and understand the project organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restructuring directories THEN the system SHALL consolidate scattered release directories into a single organized structure
2. WHEN organizing build artifacts THEN the system SHALL create a proper build output directory that's excluded from version control
3. WHEN arranging documentation THEN the system SHALL create a logical hierarchy that eliminates redundancy
4. WHEN organizing scripts THEN the system SHALL consolidate installation and build scripts into appropriate directories
5. WHEN structuring tests THEN the system SHALL organize test files by type and purpose

### Requirement 3: Documentation Consolidation and Enhancement

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating documentation THEN the system SHALL merge duplicate README files into a single comprehensive guide
2. WHEN organizing docs THEN the system SHALL create a clear documentation hierarchy with proper cross-references
3. WHEN reviewing content THEN the system SHALL eliminate contradictory or outdated information
4. WHEN structuring guides THEN the system SHALL separate user guides from developer documentation
5. WHEN creating navigation THEN the system SHALL provide clear entry points for different user types

### Requirement 4: Build and Release Process Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean build and release process so that I can efficiently build and distribute the software.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing builds THEN the system SHALL remove build artifacts from version control
2. WHEN organizing releases THEN the system SHALL create a proper release management structure
3. WHEN cleaning scripts THEN the system SHALL consolidate and optimize build scripts
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure go.mod and dependencies are properly organized
5. WHEN structuring outputs THEN the system SHALL define clear build output directories

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and consistent configuration management so that I can easily configure the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing configs THEN the system SHALL consolidate example configurations into a single examples directory
2. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration templates for different use cases
3. WHEN documenting configs THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive configuration documentation
4. WHEN validating configs THEN the system SHALL ensure configuration examples are valid and consistent
5. WHEN structuring examples THEN the system SHALL organize examples by complexity and use case

### Requirement 6: Code Organization and Quality Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized code structure so that I can maintain and extend the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code structure THEN the system SHALL ensure proper Go project layout
2. WHEN organizing packages THEN the system SHALL verify internal and pkg directories are properly structured
3. WHEN checking imports THEN the system SHALL ensure proper module organization
4. WHEN reviewing tests THEN the system SHALL organize test files appropriately
5. WHEN validating structure THEN the system SHALL ensure adherence to Go best practices

### Requirement 7: Version Control Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean version control history so that the repository is efficient and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating .gitignore THEN the system SHALL exclude build artifacts, logs, and temporary files
2. WHEN cleaning repository THEN the system SHALL remove files that shouldn't be tracked
3. WHEN organizing tracked files THEN the system SHALL ensure only source code and essential files are included
4. WHEN structuring commits THEN the system SHALL prepare the repository for clean future commits
5. WHEN managing artifacts THEN the system SHALL ensure proper separation of source and build outputs

### Requirement 8: Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized and comprehensive testing infrastructure so that I can ensure code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL consolidate test directories and remove duplicates
2. WHEN structuring test types THEN the system SHALL separate unit, integration, and e2e tests clearly
3. WHEN reviewing test scripts THEN the system SHALL optimize and consolidate test execution scripts
4. WHEN documenting tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear testing documentation
5. WHEN managing test data THEN the system SHALL organize test fixtures and mock data appropriately

### Requirement 9: Development Workflow Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streamlined development workflows so that I can work efficiently on the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development THEN the system SHALL provide clear development setup instructions
2. WHEN organizing tools THEN the system SHALL consolidate development tools and scripts
