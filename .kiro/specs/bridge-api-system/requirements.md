# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive API system that enables interaction with the gym door bridge. The system consists of two main components: Local Bridge APIs that run on the bridge device itself for direct control and monitoring, and Cloud Platform APIs that provide centralized management, user access control, and analytics across multiple bridge devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Bridge API

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to interact directly with bridge devices through REST APIs, so that I can control doors, monitor status, and manage configurations locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated request is made to `/api/v1/door/unlock` THEN the system SHALL unlock the door for the specified duration
2. WHEN a request is made to `/api/v1/status` THEN the system SHALL return current device health, adapter status, and queue metrics
3. WHEN an authenticated request is made to `/api/v1/config` THEN the system SHALL return or update device configuration
4. WHEN a request is made to `/api/v1/events` THEN the system SHALL return recent event history with pagination
5. WHEN an authenticated request is made to `/api/v1/adapters` THEN the system SHALL return adapter status and allow enable/disable operations
6. WHEN invalid authentication is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with security event logging
7. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 and log the violation

### Requirement 2: Authentication and Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all API access to be properly authenticated and authorized, so that only authorized users can control bridge devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate HMAC signatures or API keys
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log security events and increment failure counters
3. WHEN multiple authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and alerting
4. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require elevated permissions
5. WHEN API keys are used THEN the system SHALL support key rotation and expiration
6. WHEN requests are made over HTTP THEN the system SHALL redirect to HTTPS
7. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate origins against allowlist

### Requirement 3: Cloud Platform API

**User Story:** As a gym manager, I want to manage multiple bridge devices and user access through a centralized cloud API, so that I can efficiently operate my facility's access control system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN devices connect THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for device pairing and management
2. WHEN events are submitted THEN the system SHALL accept and process check-in events from bridge devices
3. WHEN user access is managed THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for user permissions
4. WHEN reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate analytics on usage patterns and device health
5. WHEN devices go offline THEN the system SHALL detect and alert on device connectivity issues
6. WHEN bulk operations are needed THEN the system SHALL support batch processing of users and permissions
7. WHEN integrations are required THEN the system SHALL provide webhook notifications for events

### Requirement 4: Real-time Communication

**User Story:** As a facility operator, I want real-time updates on door access events and device status, so that I can respond quickly to security incidents or system issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events occur THEN the system SHALL support WebSocket connections for real-time notifications
2. WHEN device status changes THEN the system SHALL broadcast updates to connected clients
3. WHEN security events happen THEN the system SHALL immediately notify administrators
4. WHEN connections are lost THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and sync missed events
5. WHEN multiple clients connect THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage broadcast subscriptions
6. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL support event filtering and prioritization

### Requirement 5: Data Management and Analytics

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want comprehensive reporting and analytics on facility usage, so that I can make informed decisions about operations and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN usage reports are requested THEN the system SHALL provide time-based analytics with filtering
2. WHEN device performance is analyzed THEN the system SHALL track uptime, response times, and error rates
3. WHEN user patterns are studied THEN the system SHALL provide access frequency and timing analytics
4. WHEN data export is needed THEN the system SHALL support CSV, JSON, and PDF report formats
5. WHEN historical data is queried THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle large date ranges
6. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs with data retention policies

### Requirement 6: Integration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-documented APIs with SDKs and webhooks, so that I can integrate the bridge system with other facility management tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
2. WHEN integrations are built THEN the system SHALL offer SDKs for popular programming languages
3. WHEN external systems need notifications THEN the system SHALL support configurable webhooks
4. WHEN custom workflows are needed THEN the system SHALL provide plugin architecture support
5. WHEN API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and deprecation notices
6. WHEN testing is performed THEN the system SHALL provide sandbox environments and test data

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the API system to handle high loads and scale efficiently, so that it can support large facilities and multiple locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1000 requests per second per endpoint
2. WHEN multiple devices connect THEN the system SHALL support at least 10,000 concurrent bridge connections
3. WHEN data grows THEN the system SHALL implement efficient pagination and caching strategies
4. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling and load balancing
5. WHEN response times matter THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-200ms response times for critical operations
6. WHEN resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation
7. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and health checks

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms, so that the API system remains reliable even during failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns
3. WHEN requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and maintain data integrity
5. WHEN system overload occurs THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and queuing
6. WHEN failures happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
7. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL support automatic failover and health restoration
